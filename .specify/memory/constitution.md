# Space Invaders React Demo Constitution

## Core Principles

### Quick Delivery
Deliver a working playable Space-Invaders variant quickly.

### Feature Priority
Prioritize visible features over code cleanliness or security.

### Tech Stack
Use React with Vite or Create React App; must deploy on GitHub Pages.

### State Management
Favor simple state management (local state/hooks).

### Rendering
Prefer canvas-based rendering (HTML5 Canvas) for performance.

### VFX
Include eye-catching VFX (explosions, particles, screen shake).

### Modularity
Keep architecture modular enough to expand if needed.

### MVP Focus
All tasks should aim for MVP delivery first, then enhancements.

## Deployment and Hosting

Must deploy on GitHub Pages.

## Quality Gates

Prioritize features over code cleanliness or security.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices; Amendments require documentation and approval.
